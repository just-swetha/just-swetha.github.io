        <h1>Swetha S.</h1>
        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>Swetha S. was born and raised in Coimbatore, India.</p> 
        <p>She derives her love for nature from her summers at Kanyakumari, 
            a coastal town with buzzing beaches and nonchalant lotus ponds, 
            and the three years she spent in the hilly town of Semenyih where 
            she earned her B.A. in English with Creative Writing from the University of Nottingham Malaysia.</p> 
        <p>She is currently pursuing an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of Miami, Florida.</p> 
        <p>When she is not reading or writing, she can be found playing Stardew Valley, 
            hoarding more packets of tea, and perfecting her cold brew.</p>
        <h2>Fiction</h2>
        <p>Swetha writes speculative fiction short stories.</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Dowry</li>
            <li>unchartered territories</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Poetry</h2>
